## Clinical Trials Dashboard

Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit using data from ClinicalTrials.gov API.
Includes:
- Therapeutic area analysis
- Geographic distribution
- Big Pharma vs non-Big Pharma
- Strategy vs reality comparison (GSK case study)

GSK pipeline data is scraped locally and stored as CSV due to Streamlit Cloud limitations.
